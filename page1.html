        >I possess no specialized knowledge of architecture, but I understand
        that in the Gothic cathedral of the West, the roof is thrust up and up
        so as to place its pinnacle as high in the heavens as possible-and that
        herein is thought to lie its special beauty. In the temples of Japan, on
        the other hand, a roof of heavy tiles is first laid out, and in the
        deep, spacious shadows created by the eaves the rest of the structure is
        built. Nor is this true only of temples; in the palaces of the nobility
        and the houses of the common people, what first strikes the eye is the
        massive roof of tile or thatch and the heavy darkness that hangs beneath
        the eaves. Even at midday cavernous darkness spreads over all beneath
        the roof's edge, making entryway, doors, walls, and pillars all but
        invisible. The grand temples of Kyoto-Chion'in, Honganji-and the
        farmhouses of the remote countryside are alike in this respect: like
        most buildings of the past their roofs give the impression of possessing
        far greater weight, height, and surface than all that stands beneath the
        eaves. <br /><br />
        In making for ourselves a place to live, we first spread a parasol to
        throw a shadow on the earth, and in the pale light of the shadow we put
        together a house. There are of course roofs on Western houses too, but
        they are less to keep off the sun than to keep off the wind and the dew;
        even from without it is apparent that they are built to create as few
        shadows as possible and to expose the interior to as much light as
        possible. If the roof of a Japanese house is a parasol, the roof of a
        Western house is no more than a cap, with as small a visor as possible
        so as to allow the sunlight to penetrate directly beneath the eaves.
        There are no doubt all sorts of reasons-climate, building materials-for
        the deep Japanese eaves. The fact that we did not use glass, concrete,
        and bricks, for instance, made a low roof necessary to keep off the
        driving wind and rain. A light room would no doubt have been more
        convenient for us, too, than a dark room. The quality that we call
        beauty, however, must always grow from the realities of life, and our
        ancestors, forced to live in dark rooms, presently came to discover
        beauty in shadows, ultimately to guide shadows towards beauty's ends.
