        >And so it has come to be that the beauty of a Japanese room depends on
        a variation of shadows, heavy shadows against light shadows-it has
        nothing else. Westerners are amazed at the simplicity of Japanese rooms,
        perceiving in them no more than ashen walls bereft of ornament. Their
        reaction is understandable, but it betrays a failure to comprehend the
        mystery of shadows. Out beyond the sitting room, which the rays of the
        sun can at best but barely reach, we extend the eaves or build on a
        veranda, putting the sunlight at still greater a remove. The light from
        the garden steals in but dimly through paper-paneled doors, and it is
        precisely this indirect light that makes for us the charm of a room. We
        do our walls in neutral colors so that the sad, fragile, dying rays can
        sink into absolute repose. The storehouse, kitchen, hallways, and such
        may have a glossy finish, but the walls of the sitting room will almost
        always be of day textured with fine sand. A luster here would destroy
        the soft fragile beauty of the feeble light. We delight in the mere
        sight of the delicate glow of fading rays clinging to the surface of a
        dusky wall, there to live out what little life remains to them. We never
        tire of the sight, for to us this pale glow and these dim shadows far
        surpass any ornament. And so, as we must if we are not to disturb the
        glow, we finish the walls with sand in a single neutral color. The hue
        may differ from room to room, but the degree of difference will be ever
        so slight; not so much a difference in color as in shade, a difference
        that will seem to exist only in the mood of the viewer. And from these
        delicate differences in the hue of the walls, the shadows in each room
        take on a tinge peculiarly their own. <br /><br />Of course the Japanese
        room does have its picture alcove, and in it a hanging scroll and a
        flower arrangement. But the scroll and the flowers serve not as ornament
        but rather to give depth to the shadows. We value a scroll above all for
        the way it blends with the walls of the alcove, and thus we consider the
        mounting quite as important as the calligraphy or painting. Even the
        greatest masterpiece will lose its worth as a scroll if it fails to
        blend with the alcove, while a work of no particular distinction may
        blend beautifully with the room and set off to unexpected advantage both
        itself and its surroundings. Wherein lies the power of an otherwise
        ordinary work to produce such an effect? Most often the paper, the ink,
        the fabric of the mounting will possess a certain look of antiquity, and
        this look of antiquity will strike just the right balance with the
        darkness of the alcove and room. <br /><br />We have all had the
        experience, on a visit to one of the great temples of Kyoto or Nara, of
        being shown a scroll, one of the temple's treasures, hanging in a large,
        deeply recessed alcove. So dark are these alcoves, even in bright
        daylight, that we can hardly discern the outlines of the work; all we
        can do is listen to the explanation of the guide, follow as best we can
        the all-but invisible brush strokes, and tell ourselves how magnificent
        a painting it must be. Yet the combination of that blurred old painting
        and the dark alcove is one of absolute harmony. The lack of clarity, far
        from disturbing us, seems rather to suit the painting perfectly.
        <br /><br />For the painting here is nothing more than another delicate
        surface upon which the faint, frail light can play; it performs
        precisely the same function as the sand-textured wall. This is why we
        attach such importance to age and patina. A new painting, even one done
        in ink monochrome or subtle pastels, can quite destroy the shadows of an
        alcove, unless it is selected with the greatest care.
