    <h1>Main Room</h1>

    <div class="p1">
      <p1>
        In temple architecture the main room stands at a considerable distance
        from the garden; so dilute is the light there that no matter what the
        season, on fair days or cloudy, morning, midday, or evening, the pale,
        white glow scarcely varies. And the shadows at the interstices of the
        ribs seem strangely immobile, as if dust collected in the corners had
        become a part of the paper itself. I blink in uncertainty at this
        dreamlike luminescence, feeling as though some misty film were blunting
        my vision. The light from the pale white paper, powerless to dispel the
        heavy darkness of the alcove, is instead repelled by the darkness,
        creating a world of confusion where dark and light are
        indistinguishable. Have not you yourselves sensed a difference in the
        light that suffuses such a room, a rare tranquility not found in
        ordinary light? Have you never felt a sort of fear in the face of the
        ageless, a fear that in that room you might lose all consciousness of
        the passage of time, that untold years might pass and upon emerging you
        should find you had grown old and gray?
